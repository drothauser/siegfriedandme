                Siegfried then moves from the glories of Darwin to the failures of our worldview, and he does so by
                taking the three swipes, it appears. (Boy, he said a lot in twenty minutes.) The first has to do with
                this idea that the Garden was a set-up. I must tell you, I agree with him; I believe it was.

            <div class="paragraph">
                Here’s the question: Would you rather have a planned crisis or an unplanned crisis? I prefer the latter.
                Just like me taking my kids to the doctor to get their chicken pox or German measles inoculations, God
                saw what was coming and decided to manage it. It wouldn’t do to have this human eating from this tree
                and a grandkid eating from that one. He let us go right where we wanted to go, but right out of the gate
                so as to put all of humanity in one situation where one payment could be made for everyone at one time.
                A shrewd, risk-management strategy.
