            <h1>THE CHRISTIAN STORY OF WHO JESUS IS CAN’T BE TRUSTED</h1>
            <h2>Siegfried Commments...</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Before finishing my remarks, which will entail the crucifixion, I’m going to give you your story from
                the standpoint of the skeptic.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                You realize we know very little about Jesus, don’t you? Matthew, Mark and Luke did not write Matthew,
                Mark or Luke. We don’t know who wrote them; they weren’t signed by anyone; there’s not even a hint of
                authorship. They certainly weren’t written by any of Jesus’s followers who were all illiterate
                Galileans. They could barely write their names much less write a gospel. No, these are stories that were
                told and retold and retold and retold until they were compiled half an empire away half a century later.
                No one went back to Judea to check out the facts. None of the gospels were written in the language of
                Palestine. There was lots of time for the folklore element and tall tales to take on a life of their
                own. So we have no eyewitnesses.

            <h2>AND THE CHRISTIAN RESPONDS...</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Siegfried then questions the Synoptic gospels as well as when and who wrote them, claiming they were late and anonymous, so we have very little to go on when it comes to knowing anything about the true Jesus of history.  But why is it so very important to the secularist to separate the Christ of faith from the Jesus of history? 
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Let’s be generous.  No one wants to base his or her life on a myth.  We want to base our lives on the truth, don’t we?  We want to see the world as it really is.  The Christ of faith is an extraordinary figure—a game changer.  And if the game is going to change, we need extraordinary evidence to support the claim—or at least adequate evidence.  We want to be sure.  But there could be a competing motivation not quite as pure.  And what’s that?  Let’s think about this for a moment…  
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Who needs to be concerned with some dusty, little, country road, first century rabbi?  He can’t make any claims on us.  But the Christ of faith is something wholly different.  He’s not only the Son of God, He’s God the Son.  He is this all-powerful, all-knowing Being who can make exorbitant and highly intrusive claims on our lives.  To escape this person, the secularist has to show that the Christ of faith is a figment of the Christian’s imagination, or he has a big problem.  And guess what?  He has a big problem.  We’ll answer the questions he makes about the gospels—who wrote them and when—but first, let me point out that in taking this tact, the secularist ignores an entire body of scripture written before the gospels were disseminated.

            <div class="paragraph">
                James wrote the earliest piece of the New Testament in the late forties.  He’s emphatic about who Jesus is.  His opening remark mentions Jesus in the same breath with God and calling him Lord, as he does opening his second chapter: “Do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude of personal favoritism...”  This is how Jews address and speak of God.  And remember, James grew up with Jesus.  They played together, worked together, went to school together.  James was never a follower or believer in his big brother… until he saw him resurrected.  He then knew full well what the score was, and it changed everything for him.  He went on to pastor the first church in Jerusalem for thirty years until he died a martyr’s death.
