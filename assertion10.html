            <h1>THE CHRISTIAN STORY OF WHO JESUS IS CAN&apos;T BE TRUSTED</h1>
            <h2>Siegfried Commments...</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Before finishing my remarks, which will entail the crucifixion, I&apos;m going to give you your story
                from
                the standpoint of the skeptic.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                You realize we know very little about Jesus, don&apos;t you? Matthew, Mark and Luke did not write
                Matthew,
                Mark or Luke. We don&apos;t know who wrote them; they weren&apos;t signed by anyone; there&apos;s not
                even a hint of
                authorship. They certainly weren&apos;t written by any of Jesus&apos;s followers who were all illiterate
                Galileans. They could barely write their names much less write a gospel. No, these are stories that were
                told and retold and retold and retold until they were compiled half an empire away half a century later.
                No one went back to Judea to check out the facts. None of the gospels were written in the language of
                Palestine. There was lots of time for the folklore element and tall tales to take on a life of their
                own. So we have no eyewitnesses.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Siegfried then questions the Synoptic gospels as well as when and who wrote them, claiming they were
                late and anonymous, so we have very little to go on when it comes to knowing anything about the true
                Jesus of history. But why is it so very important to the secularist to separate the Christ of faith from
                the Jesus of history?
            </div>
            <h2>AND THE CHRISTIAN RESPONDS...</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Let&apos;s be generous. No one wants to base his or her life on a myth. We want to base our lives on the
                truth, don&apos;t we? We want to see the world as it really is. The Christ of faith is an extraordinary
                figure - a game changer. And if the game is going to change, we need extraordinary evidence to support
                the
                claim - or at least adequate evidence. We want to be sure. But there could be a competing motivation not
                quite as pure. And what&apos;s that? Let&apos;s think about this for a moment...
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Who needs to be concerned with some dusty, little, country road, first century rabbi? He can&apos;t make
                any
                claims on us. But the Christ of faith is something wholly different. He&apos;s not only the Son of God,
                He&apos;s
                God the Son. He is this all-powerful, all-knowing Being who can make exorbitant and highly intrusive
                claims on our lives. To escape this person, the secularist has to show that the Christ of faith is a
                figment of the Christian&apos;s imagination, or he has a big problem. And guess what? He has a big
                problem.
                We&apos;ll answer the questions he makes about the gospels - who wrote them and when - but first, let me
                point
                out that in taking this tact, the secularist ignores an entire body of scripture written before the
                gospels were disseminated.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                James wrote the earliest piece of the New Testament in the late forties. He&apos;s emphatic about who
                Jesus
                is. His opening remark mentions Jesus in the same breath with God and calling him Lord, as he does
                opening his second chapter: &quot;Do not hold your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ with an attitude
                of personal favoritism...&quot; This is how Jews address and speak of God. And remember, James grew up with
                Jesus. They played together, worked together, went to school together. James was never a follower or
                believer in his big brother... until he saw him resurrected. He then knew full well what the score was,
                and it changed everything for him. He went on to pastor the first church in Jerusalem for thirty years
                until he died a martyr&apos;s death.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Paul writes his letters to the churches in Galatia and Thessalonica very shortly after James, and they
                communicate an understanding of Jesus in no uncertain terms. He writes the two letters to the
                Corinthians in the mid-50s quoting a creed about Christ&apos;s death, burial, resurrection and
                appearances
                that can be traced back to the events themselves. And Romans, his theological Magnum Opus, was written
                soon after that at Corinth. So a significant portion of the New Testament had already been written and
                disseminated before the gospels ever hit the streets, and the picture of Christ is clear and uniform.
                But back to the Synoptic gospels...
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Why does the secularist claim right off the bat that the Synoptics - synoptic simply means common
                view - must have been written in the 80s or later? Could it be that, in Matthew and Luke, Jesus makes a
                specific prediction about the destruction of Jerusalem, which happened in 70 AD, and if the gospels were
                written before that event, it would mean Jesus was supernaturally seeing into the future, and the
                secularist is just not going to go there?
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Siegfried goes on to assert that none of the gospels were written in the original language of the
                Jews - Aramaic or Hebrew - but how does he know this? The original autographs turned to dust almost two
                thousand years ago. We don&apos;t have the originals. So how does anyone know what language, say, the
                original copy of Matthew was written in?
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                He claims the gospels weren&apos;t written by those whose names are associated with them, but he offers
                no
                evidence or argument for this position. To be fair, Siegfried didn&apos;t have time to construct an
                argument.
                But, quite frankly, I&apos;ve never seen a scholar give an argument for the 80s or 90s dates or for why
                these
                gospels weren&apos;t attributable to the authors claimed. So, I&apos;m going to give one.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                One of Polycarp&apos;s disciples, (Polycarp had been a disciple of John), Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons, in
                AD180, named for us the four authors:
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-indent">
                Matthew published his gospel among the Hebrews in their own tongue, when Peter and Paul were preaching
                the gospel in Rome and founding the church there. After their departure, Mark, the disciple and
                interpreter of Peter, himself handed down to us in writing the substance of Peter&apos;s preaching.
                Luke, the
                follower of Paul, set down in a book, the gospel preached by his teacher. Then John, the disciple of the
                Lord, who leaning on His breast, himself produced his gospel, while he was living at Ephesus in Asia.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Thus, the four authors are named by name very early in Church tradition, and by credible testimony.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                That Matthew was written to the Jews originally in Hebrew or Aramaic is borne out by the fact that
                Matthew cites Jewish custom without explanation, quotes the OT profusely showing that Jesus fulfilled
                prophecy and was the Messiah, and he refuses to use the term God. Instead, it&apos;s the Kingdom of
                Heaven.
                Jews were very concerned about using God&apos;s name in a vain way, so they replaced God with Heaven.
                The
                Kingdom of God in Luke or John is instead the Kingdom of Heaven in Matthew.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                But Matthew wasn&apos;t written by Matthew; Matthew was just one of Jesus&apos;s illiterate Galileans.
                Right?
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                We know the Romans were brutal opportunists, but they weren&apos;t stupid. They weren&apos;t going to
                hire revenue
                agents that couldn&apos;t write their name. Revenue was a big part of keeping the wheels of the empire
                moving. So they were going to find well-educated, literate locals to do the job. And the social stigma
                was great; they had to be well compensated. Matthew would have had to be fully conversant in Aramaic and
                Hebrew. And the common language of the eastern Roman Empire - Koine Greek - and he&apos;d have had at
                least a
                working knowledge of his employers&apos; language, which was Latin. In other words, he wasn&apos;t
                stupid. In
                fact, the case can be made that Matthew was probably the wealthiest and best educated of Jesus&apos;s
                original disciples. So it&apos;s highly possible that this gospel to the Jews was written by Matthew. No
                other name is associated with it when it&apos;s cited by the early church fathers.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                On the other hand, if this gospel, written to the Jews, wasn&apos;t written by Matthew, why in the world
                would we associate his name with it? The Romans and Greeks couldn&apos;t have cared less that Matthew
                was
                Levi the tax collector. But the Jews would have seen him as the second most hated man in Jesus&apos;s
                entourage, almost as much of a traitor as Judas. So why put Matthew&apos;s name on it if Matthew
                hadn&apos;t
                written it. That&apos;s a marketing faux-pas of the first order. Attach Nathaniel or Bartholomew or
                Thomas&apos;s
                name, anyone but Matthew... unless perhaps Matthew actually wrote it.<span id="ref1"><sup><a href="#note1"

            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                And then why name a gospel for Mark? Who was he? A second-tier person, who, early on, was too immature
                to continue on with Paul and Barnabas on their first missionary journey; he was homesick and returned to
                Jerusalem. He then broke up the team before their second missionary trip. He doesn&apos;t square things
                up
                with Paul until Paul is in prison in the early 60s. So why attribute the gospel to him?
                They are seen as Peter&apos;s memoirs. So why not name it for Peter? Unless, of course, Mark really did
                write
                it.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                And then who&apos;s Luke? Luke is mentioned only three times in the NT, in Colossians, Philemon and
                Second
                Timothy. He doesn&apos;t use the personal, plural pronoun - we - in Acts until the 16th chapter. He
                comes on the
                scene late. Again, wouldn&apos;t it have been more astute to name it for someone more famous, known as
                part
                of Jesus&apos;s inner circle? Nope, it&apos;s named for an obscure associate of Paul. Maybe... because
                he really
                wrote it? The cool thing is that Luke gives us our best evidence for an early 60s date for at least his
                gospel. How so?
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Luke&apos;s second volume, the Acts of the Apostles, ends with Paul comfortably sitting in an apartment
                in
                Rome under house arrest, talking to anyone who will listen. And that&apos;s where it ends. Why is this
                so
                indicative for dating purposes? Because of what scholars call the &quot;conspicuous silences.&quot;
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The 60s were a catastrophic decade for both the Christian and Jewish communities. In 62, Porcius Festus,
                the Roman governor who sent Paul to Rome after he appealed to Caesar, dies. It takes Rome two years to
                replace him. In this political vacuum, the Jewish Sanhedrin seizes the opportunity to arrest, try and
                execute James, Jesus&apos;s half-brother and the first Bishop of Jerusalem, making him a martyr. This is
                a
                big loss and big news, but no mention of it in Acts. Then in 64, Nero burns down the center of Rome to
                make room for more monuments and pins it on the Christian minority, and formal persecution breaks out
                for the first time against the Christian community. They are fed to the lions, crucified, dipped in wax
                and lit for Nero&apos;s parties. Not a whimper from Acts. During this time, Peter and Paul are both
                eventually arrested and martyred. This is a double huge loss and double huge news. And still no mention
                of it in Acts. Then in 66, the first and most major of the three Jewish wars breaks out culminating in
                the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple in 70AD. Again, Acts is silent. The best explanation for
                this is that Acts had been finished and sent on to Theophilus in the early 60s before any of this
                happened or became news. And the Gospel of Luke went before that, perhaps before Paul sailed for Rome;
                Acts was its second volume. And it&apos;s reasonable, based on Iraneus&apos;s claim, to surmise that the
                other
                gospels, written by those whose names they bear, were also going public at or near the same time. The
                picture we have of Jesus is firsthand and accurate. And you have very sound reasons to believe that the
                Christ of your faith and the Jesus of history are one and the same.
