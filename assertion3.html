                This is the third of twelve assertions by the secularist followed by the Christian&apos;s response. In
                this
                one, Siegfried takes a common but ill-advised approach to Occam&apos;s razor; in his view any claim for
                God&apos;s existence is problematic because...

            <h1>A COMPLEX GOD WOULD NEED AN EXPLANATION</h1>
            <div class="paragraph">
                A logical issue, if we consider the god route, is that it violates Occam&apos;s razor - that we should
                consider the simplest explanation. Our universe is quite complex, and if it was created by some sort of
                sentient being, he would need to be at least as complex as what he causes or creates. There can be
                nothing in the effect that cannot be identified in the cause or else we are truly getting something
                from nothing. He would therefore need an explanation, and it would not be simple.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Indeed, an explanation of this being would be impossible for us except to say that the explanation is
                needed. Perhaps there was a super-duper god that created him, but then that god that created the god
                that created our universe would also be complex and therefore need an explanation. And we find
                ourselves in an infinite regress. Which is why we should heed Occam&apos;s razor. Without it, we
                don&apos;t end
                up with an answer; we end up with a draw.
            </div>
            <h2>AND THE CHRISTIAN RESPONDS...</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Siegfried then appeals to Occam&apos;s razor himself, claiming that the explanation of a sentient being
                violates Occam&apos;s razor; that being needs to be complex because the universe is complex and would
                therefore need an explanation. Which wouldn&apos;t be simple. But this is a misapplication of
                Occam&apos;s razor.
                Occam&apos;s razor doesn&apos;t require us to <i>explain</i> the cause, only <i>identify</i> it.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Abraham Lincoln died because he was shot by John Wilkes Booth. That&apos;s the cause of his death and
                the
                simple answer. I don&apos;t need to know anything about Booth&apos;s politics, his racial attitudes, or
                his
                physiology or his evolutionary history, to identify him as the adequate cause of Lincoln&apos;s death.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                This approach by the secularist is a shell game. Again, <i>identifying</i> the cause is markedly
                different
                than explaining the cause itself. And the latter is not required when using Occam&apos;s razor.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                But this error is understandable. Siegfried, along with just about everyone else in secular culture, is
                a Philosophical Materialist or a Metaphysical Naturalist. The underlying assumptions of these
                interchangeable positions is that matter is all there is, was or ever will be. They think in terms of
                physical stuff, parts, complexity; they gravitate towards explaining or understanding things in these
                terms.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                But... we just answered this question in the previous post. Space, time and matter began at the
                beginning of our universe. So the creator of matter is non-material. God is Spirit and Mind with no
                interacting &quot;parts&quot; so we in no way need the explanation for complexity that Siegfried claims
                is
                needed. The materialist loses on this one. Why there is something instead of nothing remains a
                significant obstacle for atheism.
