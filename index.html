                Getting our Christian young people from childhood to adulthood with their faith intact has never been
                harder.
                The music and film industries, the media, the academy, and even secondary education, are all
                increasingly
                hostile to evangelical Christianity. Two out of three or our youth will leave. Half of those who walk
                away do so
                for good. At the end of the day, that&apos;s a 33% attrition rate. What can we do?

                atheist Peter Atkins from Oxford debated William Lane Craig at the Carter Center
                in Atlanta. Professor Atkins not only lost the debate, he lost it badly. When atheists such as Dawkins
                or Sam
                Harris
                or Lawrence Krauss
                speak on their own, they are forceful and compelling. But when they find themselves confronted
                by a studied Christian
                apologist like Oxford mathematician John Lennox or Biola&apos;s William Lane Craig, they find the
                going much tougher; in fact,
                they are effectively neutralized.

                Here&apos;s an idea: What if we could change the environment? What if we could bring the debate
                closer to home?
                What if we could expose our young people to the best that atheism can assert and answer it in a
                safe, controlled
                environment? That is the effort being made by the production of Siegfried and Me.

                <i>Siegfried and Me</i> is two-hour intensive seminar in drama form. It&apos;s a presentation of a
                botched debate.
                Botched because of scheduling. I can&apos;t be both people at once, so I play the part of Siegfried,
                making
                every effort to lay out the atheist position as honestly, forcefully and clearly as possible.
                I&apos;ve been told
                that Siegfried makes the case for atheism stronger than most atheists could ever hope to. And
                this is a
                good thing. I want my Christian audience to experience the true force and angst that comes with
                being
                confronted by that side of the story. Only then can they begin to appreciate the true strength
                of their
                own worldview, which is presented in the Christian apologist&apos;s response.

                Business as usual isn&apos;t cutting it for this generation of Christians. Three of George Barna&apos;s
                &quot;<a href="http://www.barna.com/research/six-reasons-young-christians-leave-church/" target="_blank">Six
                    Reasons Young Christians Leave Church</a>&quot; pertain to their struggle with our lack of
                intellectual
                credibility. That&apos;s why our churches need to
                consider a different approach. Clayton Brumby&apos;s "Siegfried and Me" is an outside-the-box way to
                confront this generation&apos;s faith-spoiling defeaters. It will shock, entertain, enlighten and
                encourage
                you—especially older teens and young adults—that the Christian faith can stand the assault of college
                professors and the antagonism of new atheists.

                &quot;Siegfried and Me&quot; is an apologetics extravaganza so unique, so compelling to both heart and
                mind, that
                only an author and speaker of the caliber of Clayton Brumby could pull it off! As one who tutored a
                rising generation of apologetics scholars and activists, Clayton has "been in the trenches" and knows
                the twists and turns of the New Atheism debate like a pro, whether the road veers into science, history
                or biblical accounts. But in this performance, both sides get their due time in the sun. The case for
                atheism and for Christianity is presented in a way that may shock you repeatedly, and at the same time
                leave you shouting, "Bravo!"

                Clayton Brumby knows all the arguments against Christianity and in his play, "Siegfried and Me", he
                convincingly articulates them while playing an elitist college professor. Though the professor's
                arguments against Christianity might sound rational at first hearing, Clayton then uses his own persona
                to pick them apart and effectively show that truth is on the side of the Christian. I highly recommend
                Clayton's production to anyone wishing to prepare young students for defending their faith in secular
                institutions of higher learning and in the culture in general.
