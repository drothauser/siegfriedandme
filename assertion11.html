            <h1>SIEGFRIED’S INVITATION: IMAGINE THERE’S NO HEAVEN...</h1>
            <div class="paragraph">
                I will finish my remarks with an invitation. You like invitations—you’re Billy Graham, evangelistic
                types. I will not, however, give an altar call, nor will I pray for you.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The invitation was penned by a songwriter from the last generation—John Lennon. And it goes like this:
                “Imagine there’s no heaven. It’s easy if you try. No hell below us. Above us only sky… Imagine all the
                people, living life in peace. You may say I’m a dreamer, but I’m not the only one. Maybe someday you’ll
                join us. And our world will be as one.”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                I would invite you to do this… though I’m not holding my breath. And I have a flight to catch. So, good
                night.
            </div>
            <h2>AND THE CHRISTIAN RESPONDS...</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Before getting to God the egomaniacal child abuser, I’d like to spend just a moment on Siegfried’s
                appeal to John Lennon’s <i>Imagine</i>.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The numbers range from 55 to 80 million people—combatants and non—died in World War Two or as a result
                of disease or famine associated with the war. 94 to 110 million died in the 20th Century under communist
                governments—Russia, China, North Korea, southeast Asia.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Wouldn’t it have made a difference if Stalin had thought there was a Heaven above him or a Hell below
                him? And that he would be held accountable for what he’d done and was doing at the time? Wouldn’t it
                have made a difference if Mao or Pol Pot thought they’d be held accountable for the millions who died
                under their regimes? These dictators killed as many if not more of their own citizens than died in all
                theatres of WWII combined—military and civilian. And every one of these leaders were atheists.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                No—a world that loses its sense of a Heaven above and a Hell below is not a world where everyone lives
                in peace… unless you’re a dreamer. A world that loses its sense of a Heaven above and a Hell below is a
                world where the gloves have come off, and where all restraints have been removed. It’s a world where the
                strong devour the weak… with impunity. And then destroy each other. It is Hell on earth, make no
                mistake.
