                In this fifth assertion, our secularist brings out one of the big guns: the “problem of evil.” There
                are two major attacks on the Christian worldview, and this is one of them. We will listen to and deal
                with Siegfried’s argument using the Greek conundrums, but then spend two more blogs on making the best
                effort to answering the problem of evil. First, Siegfried...

            <h1>GOD AND THE PROBLEM OF EVIL</h1>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The real problem for you, of course, is the problem of evil. It is the 800 lb. gorilla in your living
                room.
                According to UNICEF, 29,000 children below the age of five die every day, the vast majority from easily
                preventable conditions—diarrhea, malaria, pneumonia, etc. That’s over 20 kids each minute, nearly 11
                million children every year—below the age of five. That’s a holocaust on an annual basis. And what does
                your God do? He doesn’t so much as lift one omnipotent little finger to stop this.
                225,000 people died in one morning because one continental plate subducted under another off of Sumatra
                causing a tsunami. So much for your intelligently designed planet. 225,000 is nearly three Hiroshimas.
                That same number died when an earthquake happened off the southwestern coast of Haiti, a catastrophe
                from which these poor people have yet to recover. And where was your God? Apparently, right in the
                thick of this. Your Bible. Your prophet. Isaiah 45:7:
                <div class="paragraph-quote">
                    I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these
                    things.
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                So, this is the god you love and worship? Someone who apparently delights in creating such chaos and
                carnage? I don’t get that, but... to each his own. But perhaps you can begin to appreciate why someone
                like me finds your religion incoherent.
            </div>
            <h3>The Greek Conundrums</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
                We’ve been dealing with this problem in terms of God for two millennia. The following paradox is
                attributed to Epicurus, though it’s doubtful it originated with him. But it goes like this:
                <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li>If God wants to destroy evil but cannot, he is not all-powerful.</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>If he can but does not want to, he is evil. (We’ve just dealt with this is Isaiah’s comment.)</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>If he both can and wants to, then why is there evil in the world?</li>
                    <li>&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>If he cannot and does not want to, then why call him God?</li>
                </ul>
                Do you think your young people are equipped to answer a question like this? I doubt it.
                Or let’s consider a dilemma articulated even before the Epicurean paradox—the question posed by
                Socrates to the Athenian ethicist, Euthyphro. In its modern rendering it states: Is what is moral loved
                by God because it is moral, or is it moral because it is loved by God? Be careful, Christian. These are
                the horns of a dilemma from which there is no escape. If you say that what is moral is loved by God
                because it is moral, you are admitting that moral values and duties have an intrinsic value of their
                own, and we don’t need God to tell us what that is. In other words, I didn’t need to go to Mount Sinai
                to know that murder, theft and perjury were wrong. So what role is left for Mount Sinai? What role is
                left for God? He is out of a job; he is irrelevant when it comes to morality. We don’t need him to
                recognize moral values or duties; we don’t need him at all.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                If, however, you’d like to choose the latter, that what is moral is moral because it’s loved by God,
                then you admit that moral values and duties are based on God’s whims and capriciousness. He says, I’m
                not feeling too chipper today—it’s a Monday—so let’s wipe out the Amalekites. This is your Divine
                Command theory in action, by the way; anything God commands is legal. If he commands the genocide of
                the Canaanites, go for it. Which is why Christopher Hitchens quipped, isn’t it true then that with God,
                anything is permissible? Any wonder you’re losing your young people? They are not equipped to handle an
                intellectual environment that wrestles with these ideas this honestly.
