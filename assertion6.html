            <div class="paragraph">
                There are few things one can do that is more politically incorrect than going after Darwinian Theory.
                Why? Because going after Darwin is seen as going after science itself - all things provable, true and
                real. It&apos;s not, really. In fact, it&apos;s quite the opposite; it&apos;s very scientific to
                cross-examine and
                challenge theories - to question them. And Darwinism has been dodging questions from the get-go.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Darwinism is actually what geocentric theory was five hundred years ago; instead of being a fundamental
                misunderstanding of the cosmos, it&apos;s a fundamentally wrong view of the living world. It is bad
                science
                and it&apos;s bad for science. And there is nothing that provides more of an intellectual warrant for
                secularism than this theory.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Lee Strobel, the well-known author and Christian apologist, said he closed the door on anything
                religious when he learned about evolutionary theory as a junior in high school. God just wasn&apos;t
                necessary. Richard Dawkins remarked that Darwinism gave him the ability to be an &quot;intellectually
                fulfilled atheist.&quot; And Daniel Dennett, a philosophy professor at Tuft&apos;s University, and one
                of the Four
                Horsemen of the New Atheists, has called Darwinism a &quot;universal acid&quot;, something so corrosive
                it eats
                through anything used to contain it; Darwinism &quot;eats through every traditional concept and leaves
                in its
                wake a revolutionized world view.&quot; This is absolutely true. The influence of Darwinism and its
                adherents
                are pervasive. It permeates the academy, the media, and the entertainment industry, where so much of our
                next generation is being shaped. It permeates our culture and is creating a withering nihilism that is
                destroying us.

            <div class="paragraph">
                The theory simply makes too much intellectual noise for people to hear the gospel. You don&apos;t
                believe me?

                &quot;By coupling undirected, purposeless variation to the blind, uncaring process of natural selection,
                Darwin made theological or spiritual explanations of the life processes superfluous."

                In the evolutionary pattern of thought there is no longer either need or room for the supernatural. The
                earth was not created; it evolved. So did all the animals and plants that inhabit it, including our
                human selves, mind and soul as well as brain and body. So did religion... Finally, the evolutionary
                vision
                is enabling us to discern, however incompletely, the lineaments of the new religion that we can be sure
                will arise to serve the needs of the coming era.

                Well... not so fast. Since then things have begun to come unglued for Darwin.

                In 1965, some world-class mathematicians - Murray Eden at MIT and Marcel Schutzenberger in France, along
                with others - began to model random mutations working with natural selection using probability theory.
                They couldn&apos;t get it to work - not by a long shot. Repeated attempts and adjustments in their
                assumptions
                yielded the same results. Some high-level Darwinists got wind of this and a meeting was convened at the
                Wistar Institute at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia in July 1966. The results and
                concerns were aired - mathematically there was nowhere close to enough genetic resources or the time
                needed to do anything like what was being claimed for this theory. And what was the response?

                The problem of evil has a number of different facets, which we&apos;ll get to, but before doing that I
                want
                to address the Greek conundrums Siegfried raises, because your kids are about to.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Nobel laureate, Sir Peter Medawar, told them they were thinking backwards. That the eye had evolved was
                not in question, so the math must be wrong. Really?? The fact that the earth is the center of the Solar
                System, Copernicus, is not in question, so your calculations must be off. Ernst Mayr, the godfather of
                Darwinism on this side of the pond said this: <strong>&quot;Somehow or other, by adjusting these
                    figures, we
                    will come out alright. We are comforted by the fact that evolution has occurred.&quot;</strong>
                I&apos;m
                sorry, but that doesn&apos;t sound much like science to me. It sounds like there is a lot of emotional
                skin
                in the game - like a belief or religious system struggling to survive legitimate questions. In any case,
                the mathematicians didn&apos;t have an alternate, naturalistic idea to offer as a replacement, so their
                criticisms were DOA.

            <div class="paragraph">
                But then in 1984, Charles Thaxton, Walter Bradley and Roger Olsen produced a book called The Mystery of
                Life&apos;s Origin. One of Darwinism&apos;s biggest challenges is telling us how life began. In their
                book, they
                surveyed all the origin of life research up until that time. It had all hit a dead end and hasn&apos;t
                progressed anywhere since then. Pasteur tried to tell us all this in the mid-1800&apos;s - spontaneous
                generation is a non-starter. You can&apos;t get from chemistry to biology, from the inanimate world to
                the
                animate world; it&apos;s a bridge too far.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                In addition, though, the authors floated the idea that the information in our genome was not like a
                language, it was a language - a language understood and utilized across an entire matrix of genetics and
                biology. And meaningful language - transferrable, actionable information - is inherently a rational
                artifact. Their book is considered the birthplace of the Intelligent Design movement.

            <div class="paragraph">
                Then in 1985, a physician and geneticist named Michael Denton, wrote a book entitled Evolution: A Theory
                in Crisis. In it, he took the scientific community to task. He basically said, &quot;Here&apos;s what we
                say we
                know about evolution, but here&apos;s what we really know.&quot; He went on to point out to his peers
                exception
                after exception and problem after problem. By doing so, he opened the gates for other scientists to
                seriously consider their own doubts. One of those scientists was a biochemist named Michael Behe at
                Lehigh University in central Pennsylvania.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                In 1996, Michael Behe formally falsified Darwinian Theory in examples shown in his book Darwin&apos;s
                Black
                Box. What is a Black Box? A Black Box was something inaccessible to Darwin due to the level of
                technology in his day. He thought of the cell as a simple glob of protoplasm. He couldn&apos;t see into
                its
                mind-boggling complexity, but we now can because of the development of things like the electron
                microscope.<span id="ref1"><sup><a href="#note1"

                Which is what Behe&apos;s done. But it hasn&apos;t been an easy ride for him.

                Understand, those who lay claim to the story of origins - this story tells us where we&apos;re from, why
                we&apos;re
                here, where we&apos;re going and what we mean - are the high priests of a culture. This endows them a
                tremendous amount of power and prestige. They&apos;re not going to let go of that easily. Besides,
                billions
                have been spent in research based on the assumption that this theory is true - looking for life on
                Mars - and tens of thousands of careers have been built on that same assumption. So in 1999,
                institutional
                science, in the person of cell biologist Kenneth Miller from Brown University, attempted to refute Behe
                in his book Finding Darwin&apos;s God.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Miller is one of Darwinism&apos;s most capable apologists: outgoing, witty, articulate, passionate and
                convincing because he&apos;s convinced. On stage he&apos;ll outshine Behe who is a self-effacing
                introvert. The
                problem for Miller is that he put himself in print. And in print, you don&apos;t win on style; you win
                on
                substance. Your readers have a chance to digest and reflect on the construction of your arguments. And
                Miller utterly failed to refute Behe. In fact, it was an epic fail; instead of refuting Behe, he
                confirmed him six times over. I have been very specific about this in the appendix of my book <a

                Behe had been using Darwin&apos;s own test. Darwin knew for his theory to be considered scientific, it
                had to
                be falsifiable. So he gave us a falsification criterion:
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-quote">
                &quot;If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed, which could not possibly have been
                formed
                by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down. But I can find no
                such case.&quot; (Charles Darwin, On the Origin of Species, 1859).
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Why would Darwin&apos;s theory absolutely break down if a complex organ was found? Because integrated
                complexity, two or more things operating together to perform a function, shows planning. It shows
                premeditation... Purpose and intention - thought, will and skill. It&apos;s an artifact of mind - a
                Designer.
                Darwin&apos;s claim to fame was that he could explain all of the living world as a result of mindless
                and
                purposeless processes. Remember George Gaylord Simpson&apos;s claim? &quot;We are the result of a
                purposeless and
                natural process that did not have us in mind.&quot; So Darwinism and design are antithetical to each
                other;
                they are opposites at their core.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                After reading Denton, and feeling his intuitions were valid, Behe began in earnest to document these
                &quot;complex organs&quot; that Darwin couldn&apos;t find. As it turns out, the living world is rife
                with them. In the
                process of his work, Behe came up with the concept that refined Darwin&apos;s falsification test.
                It&apos;s called
                Irreducible Complexity. Irreducible Complexity doesn&apos;t just identify the general parts of a system
                but
                specifically those essential parts that are needed for function - if one of the essential parts is
                removed
                from this system, function isn&apos;t degraded; it&apos;s lost. Period. Before I lose you, let me give
                you a big,
                clunky example: you and me.

                blood
                in order to carry out these responsibilities and that blood needs to be oxygenated which means, for the
                brain and nervous system to survive, we need a circulation system to carry blood to the brain and a
                respiratory system to oxygenate it. If we remove one of these systems, we don&apos;t work less
                efficiently;

                Darwinists will tell us that this can all be explained by the process of mutation and natural selection.
                But can it? I&apos;m just about to show you why it can&apos;t, in fact, why the fatal flaw for Darwinism
                is found
                in this little operating mechanism itself. And this is fun...
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                What&apos;s a mutation and why is it important? A mutation is a hitch in DNA&apos;s giddy-up - in the
                informational
                sequences. There are lots of types - nonsense, missense, insertions, deletions, frame shifts - you
                don&apos;t
                really need to know what these mean, only that they all are found in the DNA, which is where they need
                to be if they&apos;re to be repeatable or reproducible.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                And that DNA can&apos;t be just anywhere - a finger, fin or feather. It has to be in the DNA of the germ
                cells - the sperm or the egg - if it&apos;s going to impact speciation - the next generation. But what
                have we done
                here? We&apos;ve taken this organism-wide universe of trials (37.2 trillion cells in humans alone) and
                made
                it one that is vanishingly small - the germ cells only. Then we add insult to injury when we consider
                that
                the vast majority of mutations break things in the organism or they&apos;re neutral... like someone
                putting a
                semicolon where someone else would put a period. Only a minute percentage of mutations can be considered
                at all advantageous or beneficial.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                So here&apos;s the trick: Out of this vanishingly small universe of trials - the germ cells - that can
                only use a
                vanishingly small fraction of the mutations that arise, do we get 8.7 million species of multicellular
                life - plants and animals. The greatest percentage of that number are animals with circulatory systems,
                respiratory systems, visual systems, neurological systems, digestive and reproductive systems... All
                from
                a vanishing small universe of trials using a vanishing small percentage of mutations. Folks, if your
                baloney detector isn&apos;t at redline by now, you might want to check your pulse!
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                This is exactly what the professional mathematicians were talking about at the Wistar conference in
                1966. The math doesn&apos;t add up! It never did! The theory has nothing close to the genetic resources
                it
                needs or the time it needs to do anything like what we have around us.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                But that&apos;s not even the real issue. Here the mutation sits in the DNA. And as long as it&apos;s
                there, it is
                invisible to Darwinian evolution. It&apos;s going nowhere. It&apos;s doing nothing. Building nothing.
                Affecting
                nothing. Of no consequence, whatsoever!
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Until it&apos;s expressed. Until the DNA is opened, read and copied, you can have all the mutations you
                want.
                They aren&apos;t going to do anything for or to the organism. It&apos;s only when it&apos;s culled and
                creates the
                feature that increases fitness does it, at all, become visible to evolution.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                So, the mutation has to be accessed and copied along with the surrounding source material in the DNA it
                has affected as a mutation. And how does that occur? Well... a letter opener shows up called a helicase.
                The helicase opens the DNA so it can be read and copied. Then the reader/copier called the RNA
                polymerase shows up to read and copy the genetic section. And what has happened when that occurs?
                DARWINIAN THEORY HAS BEEN FALSIFIED AGAIN! Why? Because we have a complex in play - three things working
                together to perform a function. If the DNA and the reader/copier - the RNA polymerase - are there but
                the
                letter opener - the helicase - doesn&apos;t show up to open the DNA, nothing can be read. And if the DNA
                is
                there, and the helicase is there to open it up but there&apos;s no reader, nothing gets read. And if the
                helicase and the polymerase show up but there&apos;s no DNA, there&apos;s nothing to read. All three
                have to be in
                play for the genetic expression to go anywhere. If this isn&apos;t a complex, complexes don&apos;t
                exist. And if
                complexes don&apos;t exist, then Darwinism isn&apos;t scientific because it can&apos;t be falsified. If
                complexes do
                exist, then this is one, and Darwinism has been falsified. It loses either way!
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                By the way, Darwin knew nothing about this system, or he never would have made his ridiculous comment
                about complexes. We didn&apos;t even begin to understand the structure and function of this system until
                the
                middle of the last century, nearly a hundred years after Darwin published The Origin. But things only
                get worse for Darwin from here.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The copy that the RNA polymerase makes of the gene is typically 27,000 bases long; that&apos;s the
                average
                length of a transcript - the precursor mRNA. Using the scale of this model, the transcript would be
                3,037
                feet long. That&apos;s not one football field; that&apos;s over ten football fields long! But that
                initial
                transcript isn&apos;t usable in the gene expression system; it&apos;s a boilerplate that carries recipes
                for
                hundreds if not thousands of different finished products, so it has to be edited; what recipe are we
                looking for? And so off to the editing room in the nucleus - the spliceosome. So we&apos;re seeing
                another
                component in this apparatus! Component number four.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Once at the spliceosome, this editing apparatus is going to reduce the initial transcript by over
                95%--from 27,000 bites/bases to an average of 1300 bites/bases. 1300 is the final, usable template for
                the typical protein, what&apos;s known as the mature, messenger RNA. (Using this scale, the recipe would
                be
                144 feet long - almost half a football field long.) Again, the spliceosome can make hundreds, if not
                thousands of different recipes out of the same 27,000 bite initial transcript based on what&apos;s
                called up
                by what from where.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Understand, we haven&apos;t made anything yet. All of this is under the Darwinian radar, unseen by
                evolution.
                And all of this is going on in each of our 37.2 trillion cells at a virtual lightspeed every day, all
                day.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Now... once the mature messenger RNA, including our little mutation, is ready, it moves out of the
                nucleus
                of the cell to the manufacturing room. This is known as the ribosome. Wow. Component number five. But
                once at the ribosome, we need one more little machine, a two-headed little transfer agent named - you
                guessed it - the transfer RNA or tRNA.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The mature, messenger RNA is read in sequences of three bases called codons. So a 1300 bite recipe is
                made up of 433 codons. SAM ATE THE BUN - words made up of three letters. The tRNA lines up one end with
                the codon and brings into place an amino acid at the other end that is added to the next amino acid,
                then the next and the next, until we have 430+ amino acids in specific sequence, the primary structure
                of an average protein. This will then go off, fold up into its unique 3D configuration and be either a
                building block or a machine. It&apos;s here that what&apos;s just been built finally becomes a feature
                that might
                increase fitness, helps this little creature run faster or jump higher, swim deeper or see
                further - anything that allows it outdistance its peers in the competition for resources and therefore
                reproduction. It&apos;s only at this point that this becomes visible to Darwinian evolution; it&apos;s
                only here
                that natural selection can come into play.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                But looks what&apos;s going on. We can&apos;t get FROM mutation TO natural selection without going
                THROUGH, a
                fully integrated, multiple part, irreducibly complex gene expression system! Again, this system is
                invisible to Darwinian evolution; it&apos;s all under the radar. In other words, Darwinism didn&apos;t
                build this
                system. It&apos;s this system that makes the mutation/selection mechanism work at all! It is the
                essential
                bridge between these two components in Darwin&apos;s mindless story of life, and it&apos;s anything but
                mindless.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                So when you hear some PhD-type going on about mutation and natural selection, just rewind the tape; what
                does it take to get this to work at all?!
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The bottom line is this: Darwin can&apos;t account for how life began in the first place - how we get
                from
                chemistry to biology, how the inanimate world became animated - and never will. The theory can&apos;t
                account
                for the informational content of our source document, even though every time we encounter actionable
                information - information that conveys meaning - it&apos;s always the product of a rational source. And
                it can&apos;t
                account for the irreducibly complex gene expression system needed to access and utilize that information
                in the first place--what makes Darwin&apos;s mechanism work at all!
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                So despite the gleeful claims of Professor Dennett, Darwinism isn&apos;t anything like a universal acid.
                It&apos;s
                just a bunch of smoke and mirrors. It explains the little stuff - finch beaks and the color of moths,
                but
                not how the finch or the moth got here to begin with. It&apos;s time to move on. You and I are
                &quot;fearfully and
                wonderfully made.&quot; You can take that to the bank.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                So we&apos;re back to you-know-where. That&apos;s right - a Designer. And we&apos;ve left deism in the
                rearview mirror
                because it can&apos;t address the issue of evil, and it can&apos;t address the information in the
                genome. So now
                we are left with a theistic, designer god. Is that Designer God the Christian God? We&apos;ll soon find
                out.

            <h4>Handling dating...</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Before moving on, I want to address the dating stuff. And I must tell you, you don&apos;t need to be in
                the
                least concerned about a 13.72 billion-year-old universe. Or a 4.55 billion-year-old earth. It
                doesn&apos;t
                matter. And here&apos;s why.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                When Jesus was among us, he did some really cool stuff. He walked on water. He fed lots of people with
                next to nothing. He changed water into wine. He healed the sick, the blind and the lame. He also healed
                lepers. Now here&apos;s the question: For the older lepers he healed - the forty- and fifty-year-olds -
                did their
                healed skin have wrinkles? How old do you think a modern dermatologist would say that healed skin was?
                As old as the person who had it. And they&apos;d be right. But it was just healed five minutes ago. Yep.
                But
                it is wrinkled and is fifty years old. There are two timeframes in play here,
                chronological/physiological and created.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                How old was that wine Jesus created at that wedding in Cana? When Jesus changed water to wine, the wine
                was true wine; it had a vintage. Wine is aged, fermented grape juice. On a molecular basis, it was as
                old as it needed to be to reach full fermentation. The biochemist might hazard a guess - perhaps weeks
                or
                months, but not the minutes the guys who filled the water pots would claim. Which is right? They both
                are. Truly. Was Adam in his early twenties when he woke up in the Garden? Or was he just minutes old? He
                was both. Truly.

                When you&apos;re dealing with a miracle - fixing something or creating something - you&apos;re dealing
                with two
                timeframes - chronological or physiological and created. For the earth to be the place it needed to be
                for
                us - stable and cool, orbiting the sun we needed, with the moon we needed, they all had to be certain
                physical ages. So did the galaxy. So did the universe. And that&apos;s why you shouldn&apos;t really be
                concerned
                about the age of the universe or the age of the earth. Physics will tell you one thing, and God&apos;s
                word
                might tell us another. And both would be right. Two timeframes are in play - chronological and created.
                That&apos;s all.
