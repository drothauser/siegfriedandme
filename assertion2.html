        <h1>A UNIVERSE FROM NOTHING</h1>
        <div class="main-container">
            <div class="paragraph">
                The great pre-enlightenment mathematician, Gottfried Leibniz, articulated the first question of
                philosophy when he asked: Why is there something instead of nothing? You God-believers feel this is a
                slam-dunk for your position. It&apos;s anything but.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                First of all, Leibniz predated modern physics and cosmology by over 300 years. In modern physics, there
                is really no such thing as nothing. The closest correlation we have is a quantum vacuum. Virtual
                particles - quantum particles - pop into an out of existence uncaused out of nothing in this vacuum all the
                time. Did some preexisting vacuum produce a pop that was our beginning - the singularity? Did a
                preexisting quantum vacuum create our Big Bang?
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                God believers don&apos;t like any of this because it calls into question the need for a First Cause  - i.e.
                God. But you can take comfort in the fact that if the vacuum did create this universe, it was a very
                fortunate pop. Because of the way our universe is structured, it appears remarkably set up to allow for
                creatures like you and me. The precision we are talking about here are the values of the fundamental
                constants in physics, which are truly mind-boggling. This doesn&apos;t make my crowd comfortable. A universe
                with these settings, if the only one, looks far too much like a set-up job, like it was intended. So
                some have postulated that our universe could simply be one of a nearly infinite ensemble of universes
                generated by a universe generating mechanism - perhaps the vacuum - and we just won the fine-tuning
                lottery.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                This is a lot of speculation to be sure, but it&apos;s simply an effort to be scientific - identifying natural
                causes for natural effects. The alternative? Is our universe the product of a theist god looking for
                praisers and worshippers? I think not. The natural features of our planet, if anything, are far more
                indicative of perhaps a deist god who cared little for us and simply wound things up at the beginning
                and spun them off to see what would happen. David Hull, the late Philosopher of Science at your
                Northwestern University described it best when he said:
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-quote">
                Whatever the God implied by evolutionary theory and the data of natural history may be like, He is not
                the Protestant God of waste not, want not. He is also not a loving God who cares about His productions.
                He is not even the awful God portrayed in the book of Job. The God of the Galápagos is careless,
                wasteful, indifferent, almost diabolical. He is certainly not the sort of God to whom anyone would be
                inclined to pray.
            </div>
            <h2>AND THE CHRISTIAN RESPONDS...</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Siegfried questions the need for a First Cause i.e. God - by introducing the idea of a particular form
                of nothingness - a preexisting quantum vacuum of sorts. He suggested that this quantum environment might
                have been the birthplace of our universe. But this sea of &quot;nothingness&quot; is nothing of the sort. In the
                words of William Lane Craig:
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph-indent">
                It&apos;s a sea of fluctuating energy, an arena of violent activity that has a rich physical structure and
                can be described by physical laws. These particles are thought to originate by fluctuations of the
                energy in the vacuum.
                So it&apos;s not an example of something coming into being out of nothing, or something coming into being
                without a cause. The quantum vacuum and the energy lock up in it are the cause of these particles. And
                then we must ask, well, what is the origin of the whole quantum vacuum itself? Where does it come from?
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                What gives him the warrant to ask about its origin? It&apos;s beginning? Because…
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                If our universe came into being out of some sort of a quantum vacuum, then our universe didn&apos;t exist
                and then it did… along with perhaps a myriad of other universes that didn&apos;t exist and then each one
                did. These events where universes are produced are events in sequence, and this vacuum is a physical
                environment. So it succumbs to the age-old maxim: it is impossible to traverse a material, infinite
                past. Ok. What does this mean? Simply - if I can&apos;t count to infinity, I can&apos;t come from infinity. Here&apos;s
                the idea:
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                If I&apos;m on page 112 of this book, and I had to read an infinite number of pages before getting to page
                112, would I ever get to page 112? No. In fact, I&apos;d never get to any page in this book if I had read an
                infinite number of pages before it. That&apos;s why, when dealing with physical or material things, we&apos;re
                dealing with something that had to have a beginning.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                If this book had to have a beginning to allow me to get to page 112, our universe had to have had a
                beginning to get through a sequence of events to this point in time - this evening - and the quantum vacuum
                had to have a beginning or else we&apos;d never have arrived at the point where our universe “popped” into
                existence. This means it would need a cause - something outside of itself; something that transcends it.
                This isn&apos;t physics, folks; this is simple logic at work. And it actually lines up very well with a
                brilliant Medieval Muslim formula known today as the Kalam Cosmological Argument. The argument goes
                like this:
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <ol>
                    <li>Things that begin to exist have a cause. How do we know that? Because nothing comes from truly
                        nothing.</li>
                    <li>The universe had a beginning. How do we know this? Because it&apos;s impossible to traverse and
                        infinite, material past.</li>
                    <li>Therefore the universe had a cause.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Siegfried appealed to Occam&apos;s razor, so we&apos;ll use it in our own argument here. William of Ockham, an
                early 14th Century Franciscan monk, is credited with the formula widely appealed to even today in
                intellectual circles, known as Occam&apos;s razor. The rationale can actually be traced all the way back to
                Aristotle. The formula simply says: it is vain to do with more what can be done with less. In other
                words, if you have competing explanations for the same thing, the simplest one - that which requires the
                fewest conditions to be met - is to be preferred. We can “shave away” the others. As Einstein said, “Make
                things as simple as possible, but not simpler.”
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                So because both our universe and the quantum vacuum require a beginning and therefore a transcendent
                cause, and because the quantum vacuum is only speculation, we can shave it away as an unnecessary
                explanation.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Space, time and matter, began at the beginning of the universe, so the cause has to be outside of space
                 - non-spatial or transcendent. Outside of time - meaning timeless or eternal. And outside of
                matter - nonmaterial. Three basic characteristics of a creating being or god and that would ultimately
                include the Christian God.
