            <div class="paragraph">
                Lastly, Siegfried does what so many secularists are fond of doing: he paints God as a moral monster for
                his commanding the annihilation of the inhabitants of Canaan by the Jews. Yes, Joshua&apos;s conquest
                passages are tough to read. I hope they are. As are parts of Samuel. But there is so much we don&apos;t
                know.

            <div class="paragraph">
                Paul Copan, a professor at Palm Beach Atlantic, has written extensively on this. His book for the layman
                is called <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/God-Moral-Monster-Making-Testament/dp/0801072751">Is God a Moral
                    Monster?</a> It&apos;s not a light read by any measure. And then he wrote <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://www.amazon.com/Did-God-Really-Command-Genocide/dp/0801016223">Did God Really
                    Command Genocide?</a> as a book for his academic peers. If you&apos;d like to get deeply into the
                subject, I&apos;d
                highly encourage these two books as a starting place. But most of you aren&apos;t going to go there, so let
                me give you a way to cope with this.

            <div class="paragraph">
                My son, David, recently graduated from Palm Beach Atlantic University in West Palm Beach, FL. He&apos;s
                a
                techy. And he loves new phones. He gets the newest models as soon as they are available. On one of these
                occasions, during his undergraduate studies, he took his new phone over to Palm Beach to do a time-lapse
                of a sunrise. It was a spectacular morning. Clear and breezy. The wind was kicking up the Atlantic, and
                there were clouds in the sky providing lots of elements for the sunlight to dance off of. He started the
                time-lapse just before sun-up. We watched as the horizon grew brighter - gray and then gold - until the
                sun
                broke the surface and followed it until it was a good bit up in the morning sky. He texted it to us that
                morning. It was beautiful! So full of character! I felt as if I were there. But I wasn&apos;t. I
                didn&apos;t feel
                the ocean breeze or smell the salt air or hear the crashing waves or the cry of the seagulls or hear the
                couple laughing on the sidewalk. What I got was this. (Note 1: During the presentation, the thumbs are
                put together and the index fingers make up a finger frame the size of an iPhone.) But THIS is what was
                really going on. (At this, my arms sweeping out high and wide to show how big the environment at the
                beach was that morning.) When you read a hard passage in the Bible, be it historical or theological,
                remember, this is what you see (Note 1). THIS is what was going on (Note 2). And a little humility might
                be in order.

                I will say this: God told Abram before he was even Abraham that &quot;the sin of the Amorites was not
                yet
                complete.&quot; (Gen. 15:16). For the next 500 years, God would have to endure fingernails scratching
                down
                the blackboard before entering into judgement with this population. I do know they routinely killed
                their children... by burning them in sacrifice to their gods. And they were involved in every
                conceivable
                sexual deviancy imaginable. Now, we don&apos;t quite do the burning sacrifice thing nowadays; we just
                sacrifice our children (in abortion) for the sake of convenience or economics or for any reason at all,
                really, and we light up our tallest skyscrapers in pink lights to celebrate it. We also celebrate just
                about any sexual deviancy. The correlation between our modern culture and those inhabiting Canaan, when
                the Israelites showed up at the border, are scary.

                God created the scent of the rose, and gave us the ability to smell it. He gave us delicious foods and
                the ability to taste them. Ears to hear the wind and birds singing and the words &quot;I love you.&quot;
                The
                extravagant number of colors of the sunset or sunrise, or the colored layers of the mountains, and the
                eyes to see them. Do you think he might know what he&apos;s doing? We might not have the evidence yet,
                that
                we&apos;re dealing with a loving God, but we do know he&apos;s an exceptional engineer. And in our final
                thoughts
                to follow, we&apos;ll deal with those personal aspects.
