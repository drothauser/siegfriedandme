            <div class="paragraph">
                So, what is your story? Well... it is certainly no better. God tells you to love your enemies and to
                forgive them, but what does it take for him to do the same? Nothing short of a blood sacrifice! And that
                of his own son! Why not just forgive us?! What kind of father requires something this hideous to happen
                to his own kid? And why?! Your more astute peers, those in mainline Christianity, admit this is the most
                heinous example of child abuse imaginable! And you never stop to think about this!
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Well we do. And this is the summary of your gospel in the eyes of secular culture: God gives himself to
                himself to satisfy himself? Can anything be more egomaniacal?!
            </div>
            <h2>AND THE CHRISTIAN RESPONDS...</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                So let&apos;s finish up by addressing this criticism that God is an egomaniacal child-abuser. Why not
                just
                forgive us?
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Understand, folks, that God is not only the creator of the universe, and the great lover of his
                creation, but he&apos;s also its Chief Justice. And as such, he has an uncompromising position with
                uncompromising responsibilities. With that in mind, let me lay out a scenario to you.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                If I walk into a convenience store and shoplift a candy bar and get caught, I&apos;ll face a certain
                consequence. If I buy a twelve pack, get drunk, and then climb into a car and kill someone, I&apos;ll
                face
                another consequence altogether. In each case, the punishment fits the crime.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                But... If I sin against the infinite holiness of an infinite being, the consequences, to be just, must
                be
                infinite. The problem? You and I are finite. We cannot experience infinite consequences in a finite
                period of time; we can only experience those infinite consequences in an infinite period of time. This
                is what the Bible calls eternal damnation. Our circumstance were dire. There is but one alternative to
                this, and that is, if for us - for you and me - an infinite Being, Someone of infinite worth,
                experiences
                those infinite consequences in a finite period of time. And this is what Christians call Good Friday.

                Jesus had to be human to pick up the tab, but he had to be divine to pay it. No one else could do what
                he did because no one else was who he was - the God-man. That&apos;s why Peter told the Jewish high
                court that
                &quot;there is no other name given under heaven by which we must be saved.&quot; As Jesus said, &quot;No
                one comes to
                the father but by me.&quot;
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                Back before the world was God decided he wanted to share himself with creatures who could appreciate and
                relate to him on an emotional and an intellectual basis. He didn&apos;t want pets and he didn&apos;t
                want robots.
                In effect, he was going to have to recreate himself. But he is infinitely moral, and he was going to
                make a rational, free creature that was going to inhabit his world. He knew where it would go, if he
                followed through. And that&apos;s when the conversation was had and the decision was made that God the
                Son
                would come and do what he did. The conversation in the Garden of Gethsemane was simply the culmination
                of one that started eons before. And that&apos;s why Jesus was adamant that it would go the
                Father&apos;s way, and
                not his own, in the moment.
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                The scriptures tell us that &quot;For the joy set before Him, he endured the cross, despised the shame,
                and
                sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.&quot; Why? Why?!! Because he loves us! He loves us!!
                All
                he&apos;s ever wanted to do is share his inheritance with us and make us joint-heirs with him!
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                No. This was not egomaniacal child abuse. It was self-giving to the nth degree.
            </div>
            <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                When all is said and done, God is the best explanation for why there is something instead of nothing. He
                is necessary for creation; He is the uncaused Cause. God is the best explanation for why our universe is
                the way it is, so precisely engineered, and balanced on settings far thinner than a razor&apos;s edge.
                God is
                the best and only explanation for why there is life at all, and why it is chalk full of source
                material - genetic information - that is always recognized as the product of reason. And He&apos;s the
                only
                answer for the irreducibly complex genetic mechanism that accesses and utilizes that information. And
                he&apos;s the only explanation for why we struggle with moral issues at all. And God has taken all the
                steps
                he can to make a way home for us where we belong.

                If you&apos;ve never seen why the Christian worldview is so good, so intellectually robust, I hope this
                evening has provided some new insights for you. And if, in the process of all of this, you&apos;ve found
                your
                questions about faith have been answered, and that the Christian faith now makes better sense, and if
                you&apos;ve never done so, I&apos;d encourage you to give your life to Christ. Let him apply his
                sacrifice for all
                our sins to you, and make you a new creature, able to love him and live life purposefully and
                abundantly, as he intended. Would you do that right now? Let me pray for us.

                Holy and gracious Father, in your infinite love, you made us for Yourself, and when we had fallen into
                sin and become subject to evil and death, You, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, Your only and eternal
                Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to You, the God and Father
                of us all. He stretched His arms out upon the cross and offered Himself in obedience to your will, a
                perfect and sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the whole world.<span id="ref1"><sup><a href="#note1"

                God and Father, I receive by faith what Christ has done for me. Cleanse me of my sin in His sacrifice,
                and let Your Holy Spirit come reside in my heart, that I might become a loving and obedient son or
                daughter. Amen.

                If that has been your prayer, then I would encourage you to tell someone. And do it soon. If you
                can&apos;t
                do that, you&apos;ll never own this faith. Tell someone. Do it.
