                Siegfried, who represents the secular, intellectual community at large, makes twelve assertions in his
                presentation. These aren’t pulled from thin air; they are common positions that have been taken by
                atheists and secularists in public debates. We are going to visit all twelve, one a week, for the next
                twelve weeks. Siegfried speaks and then I (representing the Christian community) answer. The first
                assertion is where he notes that all Christian believers are, in fact, atheists, as it pertains to any
                number of historically known deities.

            <div style="font-size: large;text-align: left;margin-top: .5em">
                So let me begin by welcoming you to atheism. You are all atheists, you know… when it comes to Thor,
                Mithras, Zeus or Apollos, Zoroaster and Artemis of the Ephesians. These are all gods that now reside in
                the dustbin of history. We dispensed with them as we came of age intellectually, scientifically and
                culturally. But somehow a Bronze Age god from the backwaters of the Middle East got caught in the cogs
                of the wheels of time and ended up in the 21st Century. And you feel some weird obligation to believe
                in and worship him—to fear and grovel before him. Why we think him any different than the rest is
                beyond me. They are all gone, and for good reason, except for this one last god. So let me set you free
                from this carry over from the ancient myths. Let me set you free to move into the light of secularism
                where there are no mythical gods to fear or constrain you from being all that you can be. And I will do
                that using the best tools I have: logic and science. I hope these will suffice. If they don’t, there is
                no hope for you.

                AND THE CHRISTIAN RESPONDS…
            </div>
            <div style="font-size: large;text-align: left;margin-top: .5em">
                I’m surprised that Siegfried began building his case asserting that the God you and I worship is just
                one more of a panoply of ancient myths. This is a silly argument, to be generous, and not his best foot
                forward. How so?
                Well let me ask you: how many wrong whole number answers are there to the equation 2 + 2 = N?
                Times up! The answer is an infinite number. It’s an infinite universe of numbers. How many right
                answers are there to the equation? One—the number 4. And what does that universe of wrong answers have
                to do with the right one? Nothing. Nada. Zero. Zip. So to try to paint the number 4 with the same brush
                as all the numbers in that infinite number of wrong answers isn’t the brightest strategy, is it?
                This Bronze Age God from the backwaters of the Middle East, as the caricature was articulated, just
                happens to be in a category all by Himself—the one right answer, the one true God. Siegfried and his
                intellectual peers might do well to ask themselves why this one God survived. For all the reasons I’m
                about to give you… (in the coming weeks).
